This package provides ``nirum_wsgi.WsgiApp`` class which adapts a given
Nirum service to a WSGI application:

.. code-block:: python

   from yourservice import YourService
   from nirum_wsgi import WsgiApp

   class YourServiceImpl(YourService):
       ...

   app = WsgiApp(YourServiceImpl())

There's a development-purpose CLI launcher named ``nirum-server`` as well:

.. code-block:: bash

   nirum-server -H 0.0.0.0 -p 8080 --debug 'yourserviceimpl:YourServiceImpl()'
